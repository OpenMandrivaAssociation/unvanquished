Packaging:
	Program relies on NaCl (Google Native Client) and needs static game logic code to run inside a VM.
    These files are required to exist along side application(game engine) binaries, to load VM and logic.
        - nacl_helper_bootstrap 
		- nacl_loader
        - irt_core-x86_64.nexe
        
    Option exists to load the VM and game logic as configurable parameter to game engine:
    	- set vm.cgame.type {0,1,2,3} : where 0 is default
        	- 0: loads 'cgame-x86[_64].nexe' sourced and extracted from .pk3 data package (in -data rpm package)
        	- 1: loads 'cgame-x86_64.nexe' from with in /usr/lib[64]/... directory
            - 2: loads 'cgame-native-exe' from with in /usr/lib[64]/... directory
            - 3: loads 'cgame-native-dll.so' from with in /usr/lib[64]/... directory
      Proper package release is to rely on value '0', and not build other objects.
      
    'Stripping' of irt_core-x86_64.nexe is occuring on package assembly after build, which is causing error.
    	- resolved by adding %global __os_install_post %{nil}
							 %global __strip /bin/true into spec to disable this 'brp' script.
